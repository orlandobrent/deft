# Deft Directive Release

Structured 8-phase workflow for cutting a v0.X.Y release of the deft framework. Operationalizes the `task release` / `task release:publish` / `task release:rollback` / `task release:e2e` surface introduced in #716 (safety hardening of #74).

Legend (from RFC2119): !=MUST, ~=SHOULD, ≉=SHOULD NOT, ⊗=MUST NOT, ?=MAY.

## Platform Requirements

! GitHub as the SCM platform; the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** must be installed and authenticated. The full pipeline plus the rehearsal target (`task release:e2e`) all dispatch through `gh`.

## When to Use

- User says "release", "cut release", "v0.X.Y", "publish release", "ship a release"
- The framework's `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section is non-empty and the operator wants to cut a tagged release
- A previous release rehearsal succeeded and the operator is ready for the production cut

## Phase 1 — Pre-flight

! Validate the local + remote state before any irreversible action.

1. ! Verify the operator is on the configured base branch (default `master`) and the working tree is clean
2. ! Confirm the next version number (`X.Y.Z`) with the user. Major / minor / patch decision flows from the `[Unreleased]` content (breaking change → major; new feature → minor; fix-only → patch)
3. ! Inspect `[Unreleased]` content vs the proposed version bump. If a breaking change appears in `### Changed` / `### Removed` but only a patch is proposed, surface the mismatch and ask the user to choose
4. ! Verify `task ci:local` passes locally (or `task check` as the graceful-degradation fallback per `tasks/release.yml` line 9-10). The `task release` script will refuse to proceed otherwise -- but Phase 1 catches it earlier
5. ! Verify `gh auth status` reports authenticated (`task release` will refuse otherwise)

⊗ Skip the version-bump magnitude check -- a patch release that ships breaking changes is the kind of regression that Repair Authority [AXIOM] (#709) is designed to prevent.

## Phase 2 — Dry-run review

! Invoke `task release -- <version> --dry-run --skip-tag --skip-release` and present the plan to the user.

```
task release -- <version> --dry-run --skip-tag --skip-release
```

The dry-run prints `[N/10] <step>... DRYRUN (would <action>)` for every pipeline step. Capture the output and present it to the user, then wait for explicit confirmation before continuing.

! Wait for explicit user confirmation: `yes` / `back` / `quit`.
- `yes` (or `confirmed` / `approve`) → proceed to Phase 3
- `back` → return to Phase 1 for re-validation (e.g. user wants to amend the version or `[Unreleased]` content)
- `quit` → abort the workflow cleanly; no state changes

⊗ Skip the dry-run preview. The dry-run is the operator's last opportunity to catch a bad version number, malformed CHANGELOG, or wrong base branch before the pipeline starts writing files.

## Phase 3 — E2E sanity

! Invoke `task release:e2e` against an auto-created+destroyed temp repo to verify the full pipeline shape works end-to-end before touching the real repo.

```
task release:e2e
```

The harness provisions `deftai/deftai-release-test-<ts>-<uuid6>`, runs the smoke-test rehearsal, and destroys the temp repo in a `try/finally` clause. Cleanup runs even if the rehearsal fails. If `gh repo delete` fails, surface the manual-cleanup hint to the user and continue.

! Treat a non-zero exit from `task release:e2e` as a hard refusal to proceed to Phase 4. Surface the diagnostic and ask whether to debug (return to Phase 1) or abort (`quit`).

? **Skip allowed** when the operator has just run `task release:e2e` successfully against the same branch in the past 30 minutes. Note the prior run timestamp in the user-facing summary.

## Phase 4 — Production draft

! Invoke `task release -- <version>` (NO `--dry-run`, NO `--skip-tag`, NO `--skip-release`).

```
task release -- <version>
```

Per #716 default-draft hardening, this lands the release as a `--draft` on the real repo. Binaries upload via release.yml CI, but the artifact is NOT yet visible to consumers.

! Wait for `task release` to exit 0 before continuing. A non-zero exit means the pipeline halted partway through; consult Phase 7's `task release:rollback` recovery before retrying.

⊗ Pass `--no-draft` here unless the operator has explicitly opted into direct-publish (e.g. automated security patch). The default-draft contract is the foundation of the safety hardening surface.

## Phase 5 — Draft review gate (user-only authority)

! After `task release` exits 0, present the draft release for user review.

1. ! Run `gh release view v<version> --json url,name,body,assets,isDraft --repo <owner>/<repo>` and present the output to the user
2. ! Surface the asset list (size + filename) so the user can verify binaries uploaded correctly
3. ! Surface the auto-generated release notes (or the CHANGELOG section that was promoted into the release body)
4. ! Wait for explicit user confirmation:
   - `publish` (or `yes` / `confirmed` / `approve`) → proceed to Phase 6 (Publish branch)
   - `rollback` → proceed to Phase 6 (Rollback branch)
   - `defer` → halt and exit. Surface the draft URL so the operator can return later with `task release:publish` or `task release:rollback`. Do NOT auto-merge; do NOT silently wait

⊗ Bypass the user-only authority gate. Even under time pressure or long-context, the release MUST receive an explicit `publish` / `rollback` / `defer` decision from the user. This mirrors the Phase 5→6 gate in `skills/deft-directive-swarm/SKILL.md`.

## Phase 6 — Publish or rollback

! Branch on the user's Phase 5 decision.

### Publish branch (user said `publish`)

```
task release:publish -- <version>
```

The companion script flips `--draft=false`, then re-reads the release to verify `isDraft == false` actually flipped. State machine:
- `draft` found → flip to public; verify; exit 0
- already `published` → exit 0 no-op (idempotent re-runs are safe)
- `not-found` → exit 1 (cannot publish a missing release)
- gh-error → exit 1 with diagnostic

! Wait for `task release:publish` to exit 0 before continuing.

### Rollback branch (user said `rollback`)

```
task release:rollback -- <version>
```

The state-aware unwind detects the post-release state and applies the matching tiered recovery. Time-windowed download-count guard:
- release age `< 5 min` → threshold = 0 (rollback safe; nobody noticed yet)
- release age `5-30 min` → threshold = max(`--allow-low-downloads`, 10) (filters bot fetches)
- release age `> 30 min` → refuse without `--allow-data-loss`

Three escape hatches (escalating warnings):
- `--allow-low-downloads N` -- accept up to N downloads
- `--allow-data-loss` -- accept any count (consumer impact)
- `--force-strict-0` -- require exactly 0 regardless of release age

Race-condition mitigation: `download_count` is double-read with a 5s sleep between reads; rollback only proceeds if both reads agree below threshold.

! When the guard refuses, surface the recommendation to the user: rollback is risky on a released artifact with non-zero downloads. Prefer the **hot-fix path** (cut the next patch with a withdrawal note in `[Unreleased]/Changed` rather than deleting the broken release).

## Phase 7 — Post-publish verification

! Only enter Phase 7 if Phase 6 took the Publish branch (rollback branch ends here with the unwind log).

1. ! Verify GitHub auto-closed the discrete-task issue(s) referenced via `Closes #N` in the release notes (mirrors `skills/deft-directive-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 6 Step 2)
2. ! Run `gh issue view <N> --json state --jq .state` for each closed issue. If any didn't auto-close, manually close with `gh issue close <N> --comment "Closed by release v<version> (squash auto-close did not trigger)"` (Layer 1, #167)
3. ! Verify ROADMAP.md correctness via `task roadmap:render` (the release pipeline already invoked this; Phase 7 is the second-pass sanity check)
4. ! Verify binaries are downloadable from the public release URL: `gh release view v<version> --json assets --jq '.assets[].url'` and curl one to confirm 200 OK
5. ! For any umbrella / staying-OPEN issue (`Refs #N`) referenced in the release notes, run the Layer 3 reopen sweep from `skills/deft-directive-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 6 Step 1: any protected issue that auto-closed MUST be reopened with a comment citing #701

⊗ Skip the post-publish verification. The closing-keyword false-positive (Layer 1 / Layer 2 / Layer 3) and the incremental-renderer-drift (#641, #614) are exactly the kind of issues that surface only AFTER a release is public.

## Phase 8 — Slack announcement

! Generate the canonical Slack release announcement and present it to the user for copy-paste, re-using the template from `skills/deft-directive-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 6 Step 5.

The announcement block MUST include:

```
:rocket: *deft v<version>* -- <release title>

*Summary*: <one-sentence description of the release scope>

*Key Changes*:
- <bullet per significant change, 3-5 items max>

*Stats*: 1 release | ~<duration> elapsed | <N> commits since v<previous>
*Release*: <GitHub release URL>
```

! Populate version from the freshly-published `gh release view v<version>` output. Populate release title from the CHANGELOG section heading (or the GitHub release title). Summarize key changes from the promoted `[Unreleased]` -> `[<version>]` CHANGELOG section (NOT raw commit messages). Populate stats from `git log v<previous>..v<version> --oneline | wc -l`.

! Present the block as a code-fenced snippet the user can copy directly. Do NOT post to Slack from inside this skill -- the user owns the actual broadcast.

## Skill Completion

! When Phase 8 completes (or when Phase 5 took the `defer` / `quit` path, or when Phase 6 completed the rollback branch), explicitly confirm skill exit:

```
deft-directive-release complete -- exiting skill.
Next: <one-line guidance>
```

Where `<one-line guidance>` is one of:
- "release v<version> live -- monitor consumer reports for ~24h before cutting v<next>"
- "release v<version> rolled back -- the underlying defect needs a hot-fix in the next CHANGELOG entry"
- "release deferred -- resume by running `task release:publish -- <version>` (or `task release:rollback -- <version>`) when ready"

⊗ Exit silently without confirming completion or providing next-step guidance.

## Anti-Patterns

- ⊗ Run `task release` without a Phase 2 dry-run preview -- the dry-run is the only safe place to catch a bad version, malformed CHANGELOG, or wrong base branch
- ⊗ Skip Phase 3 (e2e rehearsal) on the assumption that "the dry-run is enough" -- the e2e harness catches gh-CLI auth issues, repo permission gaps, and pipeline-shape regressions that the dry-run cannot detect
- ⊗ Pass `--no-draft` to `task release` without explicit operator opt-in -- the default-draft contract is the foundation of the safety hardening surface
- ⊗ Auto-publish a draft without the Phase 5 user-only authority gate -- even under time pressure or long-context, the release MUST receive an explicit `publish` / `rollback` / `defer` decision
- ⊗ Run `task release:rollback` against a release that has > 30 minutes of consumer-driven downloads without first weighing the hot-fix path -- a withdrawal note in the next patch is almost always less disruptive than deleting a public artifact
- ⊗ Use `--allow-data-loss` without first reading the script docstring's hot-fix-path recommendation -- the flag is an explicit acknowledgment of consumer impact, not a default
- ⊗ Skip the Phase 7 Layer 3 reopen sweep -- protected umbrellas can auto-close on a release-merge squash even when the release notes use `Refs #N` only
- ⊗ Post the Phase 8 Slack announcement directly from this skill -- the user owns the broadcast; the skill only generates the template
- ⊗ Hardcode `master` as the base branch -- delegate to the configured base branch from `task release --base-branch <branch>`
