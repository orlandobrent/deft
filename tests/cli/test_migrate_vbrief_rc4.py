"""Integration tests for RC4 migrator fixes (#527/#528/#529/#530).

Separated from ``tests/cli/test_migrate_vbrief.py`` (already ~2700 lines)
so this surface stays under the project's 1000-line file cap while still
sharing the existing ``tests/fixtures/safety/`` inputs via the helpers
imported below.

Covers:

* #527 -- rollback RMDIRs ``vbrief/legacy/`` when the migrator created it.
* #528 -- ``SafetyManifest.renames`` drives rollback's on-disk resolution
  so renamed files (e.g. ``LEGACY-REPORT.reviewed.md``) are still removed.
* #529 -- ``**Traces**: ...`` lines are stripped from LegacyArtifacts and
  a per-task audit trail lands in ``vbrief/migration/RECONCILIATION.md``.
* #530 -- first-run migration appends ``.premigrate.*`` glob patterns to
  ``.gitignore`` (creating the file if absent), idempotently on re-runs.
