# Deft Directive — Roadmap

Prioritized work items. **Principle: resolve open issues before new features.**

---

## Phase 1 — Bug Fixes & Issue Resolution (Next Up)

Fix reported bugs and UX problems blocking adoption.
### Adoption Blockers (user-reported, highest priority)

- **#172** — deft-swarm skill incorrectly claims `oz agent run` launches cloud agents — rewrite Phase 3 to use `oz agent run` as preferred local launch path; correct `meta/lessons.md` lessons #1 and #7; update `SPECIFICATION.md` t2.5.4 acceptance criteria (**tackle next**)
- **#126** — specification.vbrief.json does not conform to vbrief schema/spec — agent generates wildly non-conformant output (possibly fixed by #72 / PR #130; verify before working)
- **#144** — Directive generates vBRIEF files with wrong narrative value type (object instead of string) and wrong child key (`items` instead of `subItems`), causing nested items to be invisible in vBRIEF-Studio — address with #126
- **#133** — Generated vBRIEF files use invalid reference types (`x-vbrief/context`, `x-vbrief/research`) that fail schema validation — blocked on upstream `deftai/vBRIEF#2` to expand the enum; vendor updated schema once resolved
- **#166** — Greptile Review status check blocks merge — no re-review after fixes pushed; `triggerOnUpdates` defaults to `false`; need `.greptile/config.json` and deft-review-cycle pre-flight check (xrefs #145, #135)

### Cleanup

- **#116** — All deft files must be installed consistently under `./deft/` — placement is inconsistent across projects
- **#167** — PRs merged but issues not closed and roadmap not updated — root cause investigation needed (closing keywords, squash merge, ROADMAP convention); update PR template and review cycle skill (xrefs #114, #123, #166)
- **#171** — Agents must not commit/push directly to master — add `⊗` hard gate to `main.md`, `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md`, `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md`, and `AGENTS.md`; closes gap exposed when an agent pushed directly to master during #166 work (xrefs #138)
- **#175** — deft-review-cycle skill: prohibit pushing while review in progress + fix polling cadence — add `⊗` no-push rule to Step 4; add `~` 60s minimum poll interval guidance (agents were spamming `get_check_runs` seconds apart with no real delay); add both lessons to `meta/lessons.md` (incident: PR #173)

---

## Phase 2 — Documentation & Content Fixes

Quick doc/content fixes that don't require code changes.

### Philosophy & Positioning

- **#89** — Deft identity and positioning: resolve naming before README reframe (blocks #84 Phase 2 README reframe, `meta/philosophy.md`, interview strategy updates)
- **#84 Phase 1** — Deft as teacher: contract hierarchy, adaptive teaching, and "state WHY"
  - Add `! State WHY` rule to `strategies/interview.md` — when making an opinionated recommendation, state the principle (1 sentence)
  - ~~Create `contracts/hierarchy.md`~~ — done (v0.10.0, t2.2.1)
  - ~~Add adaptive teaching behavior to `main.md`~~ — done (v0.10.0, t2.2.2)

### Content & Doc Fixes

- **#151** — [Playtest Feedback] First-time non-technical user session report (19 issues + 4 strategic recommendations) — umbrella issue; content/wording fixes here, strategic recommendations (cost interview, co-pilot, tiered UX, IP risk flagging) deferred to Phase 5 (xrefs #77, #84, #89, #136)
- **#159** — Deterministic > Probabilistic — design principle: prefer deterministic components for repeatable actions; document in `meta/philosophy.md` or `contracts/hierarchy.md`; ongoing application across CLI/skills/workflows is Phase 5 (xrefs #84, #160, #95, #86)
- **#168** — deft-roadmap-refresh skill: add MUST rule to confirm analysis comment posting to user — transparency improvement (xref #147)
- **#174** — deft-roadmap-refresh skill: add PR & review cycle phase — when triage is complete, prompt user for PR readiness; run pre-push pre-flight (CHANGELOG + `task check`) before pushing; after PR creation, automatically sequence into `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` (review cycle Phase 1 audit must happen before push, not after) (xrefs #168, #147)
- **#58** — Stale cross-references to legacy `core/user.md` and `core/project.md` paths throughout framework
- **#51** — Project should be fully bootstrapped with its own framework (partially done in PR #66)
- Rename: purge remaining "Warping" references from README.md, `warping.sh`, Taskfile.yml; reframe README per #89 resolution (#84 Phase 2, blocked on #89)
  - `README.md` still says "Warping Process", "What is Warping?", "Contributing to Warping"
  - Reframe from "coding standards framework" → resolved tagline from #89
  - `Taskfile.yml` `VERSION` — update to match latest release
  - `warping.sh` still present — remove or deprecate (replaced by `run` in v0.5.0)
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Warping references should flip to passing
- Clean leaked personal files:
  - ~~`core/project.md` — Voxio Bot private project config~~ — done (v0.10.0, t2.1.6: replaced with generic template + legacy redirect)
  - `PROJECT.md` (repo root) — leftover from bootstrap test run; remove or replace
  - Verify: `test_standards.py` xfail for Voxio Bot content should flip to passing
- Update `strategies/interview.md` to probe language/tool choices through the contract lens — when user picks a language, prompt to consider habit vs. suitability (#84 Phase 2)
- Create `meta/philosophy.md` — full contract hierarchy narrative for agent reference and direct user reading (#84 Phase 2)
- **#82** — Replacement strategies need accept-or-scrap exit when plan artifacts already exist (design: artifact awareness for chaining gate)
- **#81** — Add BDD/acceptance-test-first strategy (`strategies/bdd.md` — Given/When/Then scenarios drive requirements)
- **#102** — Codify Mermaid gist-rendering best practices as must/should rules (`coding/mermaid.md`)
- **#134** — Visual indicator that Deft is active — add behavioral rule for agent to confirm Deft alignment at session start and after context resets (true UI indicator deferred to Phase 5 / platform support)
- **#103** — Standalone brownfield/map analysis without requiring interview (allow `/deft:run:map` as independent entry point)
- **#127** — Improved support for Deft in existing repositories — bootstrap should detect existing code and offer brownfield/map analysis path instead of greenfield-only questionnaire (related to #103; CLI integration in Phase 4 with #53)
- Add missing strategies:
  - `strategies/rapid.md` — Quick prototypes, SPECIFICATION only workflow
  - `strategies/enterprise.md` — Compliance-heavy, PRD → ADR → SPECIFICATION workflow
  - Both listed in `strategies/README.md` as "(future)" with no backing file
- Port any remaining `SKILL.md` carry-forward content from master
  - Three commits on master updated SKILL.md (`a6f120a`, `cc442fc`, `2f2a89e`)
  - Largely superseded by `deft-setup`/`deft-build` skills; review for carry-forward content
- Codify PR workflow standards into `scm/github.md`
  - Opinionated PR workflow rules: single-purpose PRs, review required, squash-merge, well-documented
  - Cross-reference squash-merge rule in Branch Protection settings section
  - Branch lifecycle: delete remote branch on merge; prune local branches after pull
- ~~Write remaining CHANGELOG entries~~ — tracked by #71 (Phase 1)
- **#112** — External “Deft Directive” PDF is premature — describes post-Phase-1-3 state; defer distribution or add known-issues caveat; incorporate as `docs/getting-started.md` after Phases 1–3 ship
- **#114** — Document all global Warp rules used for deft development; migrate project-scope rules to `AGENTS.md`/`CONVENTIONS.md`; inventory remaining global-only rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **#136** — Warp doesn't load deft's AGENTS.md by default — document global rule workaround in README/installer output; real fix is Warp platform feature request (to be done with #114)
- **#146** — Add `skills/deft-sync/SKILL.md` — session-start sync skill: submodule update, vBRIEF file validation, AGENTS.md freshness check, new-skills listing; design complete in issue body (related: #140 CLI counterpart, #75 auto-discovery)
- **#147** — Skills `deft-roadmap-refresh` and `deft-review-cycle` not documented in README or AGENTS.md — add to README directory tree and `### 🤖 Skills` section; add `deft-roadmap-refresh` reference to AGENTS.md (to be done with #114)
- **#170** — Move ROADMAP.md updates from merge-time to release-time — batch-move merged issues to Completed during the CHANGELOG promotion commit; update AGENTS.md convention, `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 6, and any release checklist (root-cause fix for the pattern #167 identified; aligns with #74 release automation)

---

## Phase 3 — Test Infrastructure & CI

- **#74** — Automate release process (`task release`) and CI changelog enforcement
- **#57** — Add GitHub Actions CI workflow for linting and tests on PRs and pushes (minimal Python CI landed in PR #130; Go matrix + coverage remain)
- **#128** — CI vBRIEF schema sync check: fetch upstream `vbrief-core.schema.json` from `deftai/vBRIEF`, diff against vendored copy, fail on divergence (depends on #57)
- **#115** — Strengthen spec validation gate: add CI freshness check detecting stale `SPECIFICATION.md` (schema checks landed in PR #130 — `spec_validate.py` now enforces vBRIEF v0.5 structure, status enum, legacy key detection)
- **#33** — When using Docker, smoke tests and e2e tests should validate Docker (docker:up, /healthz)
- CLI tests for remaining commands: `cmd_spec`, `cmd_install`, `cmd_reset`, `cmd_update`
- Error and edge case testing for core CLI commands
- **#163** — Enforce USER.md gate in CLI path — parity with agentic (skills) path
  - `cmd_spec` and `cmd_project` should check for USER.md at entry; if absent, warn and redirect to `run bootstrap`
  - Skills path already done (deft-build); this covers the CLI fallback path only
- Code signing for installer binaries (Windows Authenticode, macOS Developer ID + notarisation)
- Low-end LLM compatibility testing
  - Validate installer and agent process (deft-setup, deft-build) on small/quantised models (e.g. Qwen3-9B)
  - Ensure strategies, interview flow, and spec generation still produce good results
  - Document minimum recommended model size in README or AGENTS.md
- Upgrade GitHub Actions to Node.js 24
  - `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`, `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact`
  - Bump to versions that support Node.js 24 when available (v5+), or set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`

---

## Phase 4 — Package Distribution & Install UX

Publish deft as NPM + PIP CLI packages for developer-audience install.
Complements the Go installer (which targets novice/bare-machine users).

- **#56** — Reduce installation friction — add shell one-liner, Homebrew, and platform package managers (absorbed #101: decide whether manual clone path stays or goes)
- **#53** — deft-install should bootstrap the current directory by default
- **#75** — Skill auto-discovery: make deft skills work in both user projects and deft development (symlinks/copies to `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc.)
- **#11** — NPM + PIP CLI distribution (`npm i -g @deftai/directive`, `pipx install deft-cli`)

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 complete (clean content), issue #4 resolved (project-local layout)

Scope: `deft install`, `deft bootstrap`, `deft update`, `deft doctor` commands,
GitHub Actions publish workflows (tag → npm publish + twine upload),
README updated with NPM + PIP install paths alongside Go binary.

---

## Phase 5 — CLI Overhaul & New Features

Larger feature work — only after issues are resolved and content is stable.

- **#84 Phase 3** — Deft as teacher: teach strategy, lessons evolution
  - Build `strategies/teach.md` — Feynman technique applied to Deft itself, philosophy as a conversation
  - Evolve `lessons.md` — when adding a lesson, include not just *what* was learned but *why it matters* in the contract hierarchy
- **#52** — Install into `.deft/` (hidden directory) instead of `deft/`
- **#55** — Register Deft commands as native agent slash commands (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) — also absorbs slash-command registration scope from #54
- **#46** — Provide a way for users to update meta MD files (SOUL, MORALS, CODE-FIELD, USER, etc.)
- **#77** — Allow users to change technical rating (1/2/3) when starting a new project
- **#78** — Bootstrap: offer to update user preferences when USER.md already exists
- **#86** — Artifact-branch binding and complete audit trail for SDD (dual-format persistence, branch lifecycle hooks, artifact manifest)
- **#76** — Obsidian Vault generation as structured agent memory (interlinked markdown notes, per-agent knowledge scopes)
- **#12** — Deft Bootstrap CLI with TUI (Typer + Textual, strategy-aware feature branching, agent config generation)
- **#9** — Issue tracking system integration (GitHub Issues, Jira, Asana — optional, via MCP)
- **#95** — Compliance-aligned constitution templates + readiness scanners (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, HiTrust); sub-issues #96–#100 cover config schema, control mapping registry, scoring, evidence gap analysis, and automation hooks
- **#140** — Automatically check for updates to cloned repos in a project — detect stale cloned dependencies, notify user; part of future `deft doctor`/`deft update` (new CLI tooling)
- **#160** — Consider TypeScript instead of Python for `run` CLI — architectural decision for CLI overhaul; decide before #11 and #12 (xrefs #118)
- LLM-assisted content validation
- Self-upgrade to Deft Directive product (branding, public docs, distribution packaging)
