# Changelog

All notable changes to the Deft framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **oz agent run correction**: Corrected `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` Phase 3 — `oz agent run` is local (preferred automated launch path), `oz agent run-cloud` is the cloud path; rewrote options A/B/C, fixed prerequisites and anti-patterns; added correction addenda to `meta/lessons.md` lessons #1 and #7; updated `SPECIFICATION.md` t2.5.4 acceptance criteria (#172)

### Changed
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-03)**: Triaged 5 new issues — #170 (move ROADMAP.md updates to release-time, Phase 2), #171 (hard gate against agent direct-to-master commits, Phase 1 Cleanup), #172 (deft-swarm skill oz agent run/run-cloud correction, Phase 1 Adoption Blockers — priority next), #174 (deft-roadmap-refresh review cycle chaining after PR push, Phase 2), #175 (deft-review-cycle no-push-during-review + polling cadence, Phase 1 Cleanup); analysis comments posted on all issues; meta/lessons.md updated with 3 new Windows/review-cycle encoding and monitoring lessons

### Added
- **Greptile integration guide**: Added 	ools/greptile.md â€” recommended Greptile dashboard and per-repo settings for teams using deft, covering 	riggerOnUpdates/statusCheck configuration, check runs vs. commit statuses distinction, troubleshooting, and anti-patterns (#166, t1.7.1)
- **Holzmann Power of Ten adaptation**: Added `coding/holzmann.md` â€” JPL/NASA Power of Ten rules (Holzmann, 2006) adapted for Deft with RFC 2119 notation; covers simple control flow, bounded loops, fixed resource allocation, small functions, runtime checks, minimal data scope, error/return checking, restricted metaprogramming/indirection, and maximum static checking (#104)
- **Superpowers adoption plan**: Added `docs/superpowers.md` â€” prioritized adoption plan identifying 8 patterns from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) worth integrating into the Deft Directive (systematic debugging, verification gate, code review protocol, rationalization prevention, subagent dispatch, no-placeholders rule, git worktrees, branch completion)

### Changed
- **Mermaid gist-rendering guidance**: Codified GitHub/Gist sequence-diagram readability rules in `languages/mermaid.md` as explicit RFC2119 MUST/SHOULD guidance: do not rely on `init.background`/`themeCSS` alone, use a grey participant-only `box ... end`, keep messages/notes outside the box, and keep sequence workarounds diagram-type-scoped; added regression tests in `tests/content/test_mermaid_guidance.py` (#102)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- **README restructure**: Moved Getting Started section (install, setup, spec, build) from below the architecture/layers documentation to immediately after the TL;DR; added prominent installer download callout at the top of the page (#137, t2.5.3)
- **Language removed from USER.md**: Removed `**Primary Languages**` field from USER.md template and Phase 1 interview (Track 1 Step 2, Track 2 Step 2, Track 3 language inference) â€” language is a project-level concern determined per-project via codebase inference, not a user preference (#107, t1.1.3)
- **Deployment platform question**: Phase 2 Track 1 now asks deployment platform (cross-platform, Windows-native, macOS-native, Linux/Unix, embedded, web/cloud, mobile, other) before language â€” platform context drives a filtered language shortlist with progressive "Other" disclosure and missing-standards-file warning (#108, t1.1.4)

### Fixed
- **deft-review-cycle Greptile pre-flight**: Added Pre-Flight Check section to skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md â€” verifies 	riggerOnUpdates is enabled before entering the review/fix loop, documents that Greptile posts check runs (Checks API) not commit statuses, adds @greptileai manual re-trigger fallback and anti-pattern for using wrong API endpoint (#166, t1.7.1)
- **Testing enforcement gate**: Added `!` hard gate rule to `main.md` Decision Making â€” no implementation is complete until tests written and `task check` passes; a general 'proceed' does not waive testing; added anti-pattern to `deft-build/SKILL.md` (#68, t1.6.1)
- **Change lifecycle gate enforcement**: Strengthened `/deft:change` rule in `main.md` â€” broad 'proceed'/'do it'/'go ahead' explicitly does NOT satisfy the gate; user must acknowledge the **named** change; added pre-flight gate to `deft-build/SKILL.md`, checklist item to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, verification step to `deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Phase 1 audit; Phase 1 audit gaps now batched with Phase 2 fixes (#123, t1.6.2)
- **Context-aware branching for solo projects**: Added solo-project qualifier to `main.md` change lifecycle rule â€” `/deft:change` mandatory for team projects (2+ contributors), recommended for solo projects with quality gate as enforcement; mandatory regardless of team size for cross-cutting, architectural, or high-risk changes; full config-driven approach deferred to Phase 5 (#138, t1.6.3)
- **vBRIEF source step enforcement**: Added `âŠ—` rule to `main.md` vBRIEF Persistence â€” SPECIFICATION.md must never be written directly, must be generated from `specification.vbrief.json`; added anti-pattern to `deft-build/SKILL.md` (#139, t1.6.4)
- **deft-review-cycle Greptile signal**: Updated `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` Step 4 to document that Greptile may advance its review by editing an existing PR issue comment rather than creating a new PR review object; added dual-surface detection guidance (issue comments as primary signal, PR review objects as secondary) with `updated_at` timestamp checking; added anti-pattern for relying solely on `pulls/{number}/reviews` (#145, t2.5.2)
- **Phase 2 inference boundary**: Added âŠ— rules to `deft-setup/SKILL.md` Phase 2 Inference section â€” MUST NOT scan `./deft/` for build files or run git commands inside `./deft/`; only inspect project root and non-deft subdirectories (#79, t1.1.1)
- **Phase 2 project name fallback**: Added fallback rule â€” when no build files exist at project root, default project name to current directory name and ask for confirmation (#80, t1.1.2)
- **AGENTS.md headless bypass**: Added headless/task-mode bypass to First Session gate so cloud agents, CI agents, and scheduled tasks skip interactive onboarding when dispatched with an explicit task (#142, t1.1.5)
- **CLI version display**: All `cmd_*` functions now print `Deft CLI v{VERSION}` on startup â€” previously `cmd_validate`, `cmd_doctor`, and `cmd_update` had no version display; existing headers normalized from `Deft v` to `Deft CLI v` (#49, t1.3.2)
- **CLI code quality sweep** (#118):
  - Removed stale `v0.3.7` from module docstring â€” VERSION constant (`0.4.2`) is the single source of truth
  - Removed `Requires: Python 3.6+` from docstring â€” conflicts with `run.bat` enforcing 3.13+; `run.bat` handles Windows version check independently
  - Changed bare `except:` in `cmd_spec` project-name parsing to `except (OSError, UnicodeDecodeError):` â€” no longer swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit`
  - Documented `--force` flag in `usage()` help text for the `spec` command
  - Fixed `DEFT_PRD_PATH` env var misuse on Light sizing path â€” Light path now reads `DEFT_INTERVIEW_PATH` instead of overloading the PRD env var
- **Installer post-install text** (#131): Verified already fixed in v0.8.0 â€” `PrintNextSteps` says "Use AGENTS.md" (not "read agents.md")

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Review Cycle Skill**: Added `skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` â€” Greptile bot reviewer response workflow covering Phase 1 deft process audit, Phase 2 review/fix loop (batch fixes, wait-for-bot, exit condition), GitHub review submission rules, and anti-patterns; enables cloud agents to run autonomous PR review cycles; thin pointer added at `.agents/skills/deft-review-cycle/SKILL.md` (#135)
- **Roadmap Refresh Skill**: Added `skills/deft-roadmap-refresh/SKILL.md` â€” structured contributor workflow for triaging open issues into the phased roadmap (discovery, one-at-a-time analysis with human review, cleanup)
- **Roadmap Maintenance Strategy**: Added `strategies/roadmap.md` â€” optional user-facing guide for maintaining a living roadmap with agent-assisted triage
- **Agent Skill Pointer**: Added `.agents/skills/deft-roadmap-refresh/SKILL.md` thin pointer for auto-discovery
- **Swarm Skill**: Added `skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` â€” parallel local agent orchestration workflow with 6 phases (Select, Setup, Launch, Monitor, Review, Close), proven prompt template, file-overlap audit gate, monitoring checkpoints, takeover triggers, and anti-patterns; thin pointer at `.agents/skills/deft-swarm/SKILL.md` (#152)
- **history/changes/ README**: Added `history/changes/README.md` documenting the change lifecycle artifact structure â€” directory layout, lifecycle stages, and rules (#59, t2.1.2)
- **Contract hierarchy**: Created `contracts/hierarchy.md` documenting two hierarchy lenses â€” durability axis (Standards > APIs > Specs > Code) and generative axis (Spec â†’ Contracts â†’ Code); includes RFC2119 legend, examples, and anti-patterns (#84 Phase 1, t2.2.1)
- **Adaptive teaching behavior**: Added three adaptive teaching rules to `main.md` Agent Behavior section â€” be concise when accepted, explain reasoning when questioned, never lecture unprompted (#84 Phase 1, t2.2.2)

### Fixed
- **commands.md vBRIEF vocabulary**: Status lifecycle rule and example now use canonical vBRIEF v0.5 vocabulary â€” plan-level `draft`/`proposed`/`approved`, task-level `pending`/`running`/`completed`/`blocked`/`cancelled`; added missing `narrative` to task t3 in example; no use of legacy `todo`/`doing`/`done` (#25, t2.1.5)
- **core/project.md cleanup**: Replaced leaked personal project content with generic template; added legacy-location redirect note pointing to `./PROJECT.md` as the canonical path (t2.1.6)

### Changed
- **Yolo Strategy Deduplication**: Refactored `strategies/yolo.md` to reference `interview.md` for shared Light/Full path flows, SPECIFICATION guidelines, and Artifacts Summary â€” reduced from 165 to ~115 lines (#23)
- **Chaining Gate Cleanup**: Removed "Brownfield" alias from `interview.md` chaining gate options â€” now just "Map"
- **SpecKit Cross-Reference**: Added **âš ï¸ See also** banner to `strategies/speckit.md` (#24)
- **Strategies README**: Removed redundant `brownfield.md` row from strategy table; added roadmap strategy
- **README.md**: Updated directory tree and strategies reference list to reflect `default.md` deletion and `brownfield.md` redirect
- **Baseline Snapshot**: Regenerated `tests/content/snapshots/baseline.json` to reflect strategy file changes
- **Roadmap Refresh**: Triaged 12 new issues (#124, #126, #127, #131, #133â€“#140) into roadmap phases; moved #67, #91, #92 to Completed; cleaned stale index entries; filed upstream deftai/vBRIEF#2 for #133
- **Roadmap Refresh (2026-04-02)**: Triaged 5 new issues â€” #142 (AGENTS.md onboarding gate blocks headless/cloud agents, Phase 1), #144 (vBRIEF wrong narrative type + items/subItems, Phase 1 with #126), #145 (deft-review-cycle Greptile signal bug, Phase 1), #146 (deft-sync session-start skill, Phase 2), #147 (skills undocumented in README/AGENTS.md, Phase 2); fixed index formatting

### Removed
- **Redundant Strategy Files**: Deleted `strategies/default.md` (fully superseded by `interview.md`) and replaced `strategies/brownfield.md` with a redirect to `map.md` (#31, #50)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Minimal CI Workflow**: Added .github/workflows/ci.yml â€” runs 	ask check (ruff, mypy, pytest) on all PRs and master pushes; gates merges until lint + tests pass (#57 partial)
- **Toolchain Validation Directive**: Added `coding/toolchain.md` with RFC2119 pre-implementation gate â€” MUST verify task runner, language compiler/runtime, and platform SDK (if applicable) before beginning implementation, stop and report if any are missing; pointer added to `coding/coding.md`; toolchain check added to `strategies/interview.md` Acceptance Gate and `skills/deft-build/SKILL.md` Step 2; iOS/Swift incident codified in `meta/lessons.md` (#106)
- **Build Output Validation Directive**: Added `coding/build-output.md` with RFC2119 rules for post-build artifact verification â€” MUST verify expected output files exist and are structurally valid after custom build scripts, especially non-compiled assets bundlers don't track; referenced from `coding/coding.md`; added `### Build Output Tests` section to `coding/testing.md`; codified root cause in `meta/lessons.md` (#105)
- **AGENTS.md Development Process**: Added "Development Process (always follow)" section codifying pre-code spec review, pre-commit `task check` gate, CHANGELOG/PR-template requirements, and commit message conventions â€” ensures agents follow deft conventions automatically via Warp project rules (partially addresses #114)

### Fixed
- **vBRIEF Generation Chain**: Fixed five-component vBRIEF generation chain that produced invalid `specification.vbrief.json` files â€” validator now enforces vBRIEF v0.5 schema (`vBRIEFInfo` envelope + `plan` object with `title`/`status`/`items`); migrated `specification.vbrief.json` and `plan.vbrief.json` from legacy flat format to conformant v0.5; renderer reads from new structure; `make-spec.md` and `deft-setup/SKILL.md` now include concrete vBRIEF output examples; `CONVENTIONS.md` corrected from documenting wrong format; `working-memory.md` example and `long-horizon.md` status lifecycle updated to v0.5 vocabulary; vBRIEF file validation tests added (#72, t1.2.1, t1.2.2)
- **vBRIEF Repo Reference Inconsistency**: Normalized vBRIEF source repo URL from `visionik/vBRIEF` to `deftai/vBRIEF` across `REFERENCES.md` and `vbrief/vbrief.md`
- **CLI Command Chaining Loop**: `cmd_project` no longer falls through and re-runs the entire questionnaire after `cmd_install` chains through `cmd_project` â†’ `cmd_spec` â€” the original call now returns cleanly (#117, closes #91)
- **Strategy Selection Infinite Loop**: Strategy selection in `cmd_bootstrap` and `cmd_project` no longer enters an unbreakable loop when `strategies/` is empty or unresolvable â€” callers now warn and default to Interview when no strategy files are found (#92)
- **Strategy Fallback Value**: Strategy parsing fallback changed from deprecated `("default", "Default")` to `("interview", "Interview")` in both `cmd_bootstrap` and `cmd_project`
- **Broken Strategy Link in Generated Files**: Generated USER.md/PROJECT.md no longer writes a broken markdown link to `strategies/interview.md` when `strategies/` is empty â€” uses plain text instead (PR #120 review fix)

### Changed
- **Roadmap Triage**: Triaged issues #101â€“#108 into roadmap phases; #101 absorbed into #56; #105/#106 (directive gaps) and #107/#108 (language selection UX) added to Phase 1; #102/#103/#104 (docs/standards) added to Phase 2

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Agent Skill Auto-Discovery**: Added `.agents/skills/deft/`, `deft-setup/`, `deft-build/` thin pointer files to the repo â€” Warp and other agents now auto-discover deft skills on startup without user prompting (#94)
- **WriteAgentsSkills**: Installer now creates `.agents/skills/` in user project root during install so agents auto-discover deft skills immediately (#94)
- **Prescriptive Change Lifecycle Rule**: Added `! Before implementing any planned change that touches 3+ files or has an accepted plan artifact, propose /deft:change <name> and wait for confirmation` to `main.md` Decision Making section (#94)

### Changed
- **PrintNextSteps**: Installer output updated to reflect auto-discovery â€” no longer tells users to manually say 'read AGENTS.md and follow it' (#94)
- **AGENTS.md** (in-repo): Removed redundant Skills line â€” `.agents/skills/` handles discovery (#94)
- **agentsMDEntry**: Removed Skills line from install-generated AGENTS.md â€” `.agents/skills/` handles discovery, resolving the TODO from #75 (#94)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **AGENTS.md Onboarding**: Install-generated `AGENTS.md` now contains self-contained bootstrap logic â€” first-session phase detection (USER.md â†’ Phase 1, PROJECT.md â†’ Phase 2, SPECIFICATION.md â†’ Phase 3), returning-session guidance, and available commands reference (#54, closes #85)
- **Installer 'Next Steps' Output**: Removed false claim that agents read AGENTS.md automatically; users are now told to explicitly say `read AGENTS.md and follow it` with a note that auto-discovery is planned for a future release (#54, #85)
- **README Getting Started**: Removed false-automatic claims from Step 2 and manual clone path; added explicit agent kick-off instructions (#54, #85)
- **In-repo AGENTS.md**: Updated deft repo's own AGENTS.md with developer-focused content and correct root-relative paths (no `deft/` prefix) (#54)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Go Installer**: Cross-platform self-contained installer in `cmd/deft-install/` with 5 platform binaries, interactive setup wizard, and platform-aware git installation paths (#34, #35)

  - CLI strategy picker now shows one-line descriptions and a â˜… RECOMMENDED marker for `interview`
  - CLI custom rules prompt now collects actual rules line-by-line instead of accepting a single silent string
  - CLI meta-guidelines (SOUL.md, morals.md, code-field.md) now default to **included** with paragraph descriptions; users can drop any they don't want
  - `deft-setup` SKILL.md strategies table corrected: `interview`, `yolo`, `map`, `discuss`, `research`, `speckit`
  - `deft-setup` Track 1 now presents all three meta-guidelines as included by default with descriptions; user can drop any; Tracks 2/3 include all silently
  - `deft-setup` USER.md template now includes `## Experimental Rules` section when rules are selected
  - `deft-setup` custom rules step now instructs agents to collect rules one per line
- **Interview Strategy Reconciliation**: Unified CLI and agent entry points around strategy-driven spec flow, including sizing gate behavior (#36, #35)

- **Trunk-Based Workflow**: Updated docs/workflow to remove stale beta-branch model and reflect short-lived feature branches (#69, #70)
- **Bootstrap Defaults**: `cmd_project` defaults project name from current directory and defaults "run spec now" to Yes (#47, #66)
- **Bootstrap Strategy Default**: Default strategy now uses `interview` instead of alphabetical first match (#66)
- **Tooling Dependency**: Bumped `black` from `26.3.0` to `26.3.1` (#48)
- **CHANGELOG Cleanup**: Backfilled post-0.6.0 entries, corrected release links to `deftai/directive`, and added missing `[Unreleased]` link reference (#71)

### Fixed
- **Double Prompting in Bootstrap Chain**: `cmd_project` now reads USER.md defaults (languages/strategy/coverage) instead of re-asking from scratch (#7, #43)
- **Ctrl+C Resume Protection**: Bootstrap/project flows now persist progress and support resume after interruption (#8, #66)
- **Input Validation Gaps**: Added validation for project type, language/strategy selections, coverage bounds, and duplicate selections (#44, #47, #66)
- **USER.md Overwrite Flow**: Added explicit keep/overwrite behavior when USER.md already exists (#44, #66)
- **Installer Exit Prompt on Unix**: `pressEnterToExit()` is now Windows-only, removing extra pause on macOS/Linux (#60, #66)

### Removed

- **Unity Platform Standards**: `platforms/unity.md` â€” Unity 6+ development standards covering project structure, MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects, performance, Addressables, testing, and source control (#27)

### Changed
- **Strategy Renames**: `default.md` â†’ `interview.md`, `brownfield.md` â†’ `map.md` (#16)
- **Command Prefix**: Change lifecycle uses `/deft:change` (not `/deft:run:change`); session uses `/deft:continue`/`/deft:checkpoint` (#20)

- **strategies/README.md**: Added Command column to strategy table, updated selection examples (#16)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Branch sync**: Merged master (v0.2.3 through v0.4.3) into beta (v0.5.0/v0.5.1) to unify both branches after significant divergence from the v0.2.2 fork point

### Conflict Resolutions
- **CHANGELOG.md**: interleaved both sides chronologically (v0.5.1 â†’ v0.2.3)
- **templates/make-spec.md**: kept beta's vBRIEF specification flow
- **templates/user.md.template**: kept beta's slim override-only template (v0.5.0 intentionally removed duplicated Workflow/AI Behavior sections)
- **core/project.md**: kept master's generic Iglesia template with Volatile Dependency Abstraction rules (beta had project-specific voxio-bot config)
- **docs/claude-code-integration.md**: kept beta's relocated paths (USER.md at ~/.config/deft/, PROJECT.md at project root)
- **run / run.bat**: kept beta's more evolved CLI (2500+ lines with strategies, vBRIEF, and expanded language/deployment support)
- **README.md**: hybrid â€” master's Mermaid diagrams and copyright notice combined with beta's updated file paths and next-steps text
